# Deploy to Vercel - Get Your Public URL! 🚀

Your code is now on GitHub! Here's how to deploy it to Vercel and get a shareable link:

## Quick Deploy Steps:

### 1. Go to Vercel
Visit: **https://vercel.com**

### 2. Sign Up / Login
- Click "Sign Up" or "Log In"
- **Use "Continue with GitHub"** (easiest since your code is already there)

### 3. Add New Project
- Click **"Add New..."** or **"New Project"** button

### 4. Import Your Repository
- You'll see a list of your GitHub repositories
- Find **"OptionsDashboard"** (muralikonda/OptionsDashboard)
- Click **"Import"**

### 5. Configure (Auto-Detected)
Vercel will automatically detect:
- ✅ Framework: **Next.js**
- ✅ Build Command: `npm run build`
- ✅ Output Directory: `.next`
- ✅ Install Command: `npm install`

**Just click "Deploy"** - no changes needed!

### 6. Wait for Deployment (~2 minutes)
- Watch the build logs
- You'll see it installing dependencies
- Then building your Next.js app
- Finally deploying!

### 7. Get Your Public URL! 🎉
Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
- `https://options-dashboard.vercel.app`
- Or `https://options-dashboard-muralikonda.vercel.app`

## Share Your Dashboard!

**Copy that URL and share it with your friend!** They can access it from anywhere.

## Automatic Updates
Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel will automatically:
- Detect the changes
- Rebuild your app
- Deploy the new version

Your friend will always see the latest version!

## Optional: Custom Domain
You can add a custom domain in Vercel settings if you want a different URL.

**That's it! Your dashboard will be live and shareable in just a few minutes!** 🚀
